Installation
------------

To install markov-complete, run:

    $ make libs
    $ sudo make install-libs
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

A vim plugin will be installed in /etc/vimrc/plugin. WeeChat will be installed
in /usr/local/bin/ with new default keybindings for markov-complete. You may
need to regenerate ~/.weechat/weechat.conf.

To patch readline once you've completed the above steps, run:

    $ export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libreadline.so.7.0

Programs which dynamically link to readline will now use the patched version.


Generating the chain
--------------------

You will need a "markov-chain" file in order to receive suggestions. Once
you've installed markov-complete, run (from this directory):

    $ cd markov/markov
    $ cp <path-to-your-corpus-text> corpus-text
    $ cat corpus-text | ./generate.py
    $ ./transpile.py chain.json > markov-chain
    $ sudo cp markov-chain /usr/local/share/


Usage
-----

Once you've typed a few words in a program that uses markov-complete, press
` (backtick) to autocomplete the next word. Press Ctrl+o to cycle through
Markov suggestions. Ctrl+Shift+` will enter a normal backtick.


System requirements
-------------------

markov-complete has been tested on Debian stretch (9.0). It may work on other
systems (possibly with some minor modifications).
