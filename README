To use markov-complete, run:

    $ sudo make install-libs
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

A vim plugin will be installed in /etc/vimrc/plugin. The default WeeChat
configuration file will be updated with markov-complete keybindings.

To patch readline once you've completed the above steps, run:

    $ export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libreadline.so.7.0

Programs which dynamically link to readline will now use the patched version.

markov-complete has been tested on Debian stretch (9.0). It may work on other
systems (possibly with some minor modifications).

Once you've typed a few words in a program that uses markov-complete, press
` (backtick) to autocomplete the next word. Press Ctrl+O to cycle through
Markov suggestions. Ctrl+Shift+` will enter a normal backtick.
